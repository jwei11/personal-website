summary: 'The struggle of man to achieve free will'

I must preface this by saying that I am no expert in this subject. I have merely come across this subject and done some surface-level Internet research. Reading the works of Plato, Hegel, Hobbes, and Daniel Dennett likely provides deeper analysis of the subject. I am here to simply provide my own perspective.

Let us first dive into what man's free will is.

## The Definition of Free Will

Just as any old typical topic exploration begins, let us refer to Oxford Languages. Free will is defined as "the power of acting without the constraint of necessity or fate; the ability to act at one's own discretion." So, free will is essentially being able to act without restraint. If I want to take a shower after a long day, I use, theoretically, my free will to take that shower. 

So, we see that, in its simplest form, it is wanting to do something, and being able to do it freely. Yet, we can expand the definition to a broader scale, where our desires may not be as linear. Say I have a goal of make a million dollars before I am twenty years old. Free will, theoretically, would allow me to produce and act in a series of ways to achieve such a goal, although whether I pursue the correct path is another question. Each action will produce an optimal result I desire, which will culminate in my bank account reaching seven figures before I turn twenty.

However, this poses another interesting question: if I do need to choose a correct sequence of events, and there are realities where I do not meet my goal, is it really free will. Would free will not be just be the ability to achieve whatever I desire? While this could, technically speaking, fall under the umbrella of free will, I feel that this is an idealistic version of free will. In this case, we would have the free will to become God, turn everyone into monkeys, or become the world's first trillionaire (or, perhaps, Elon has already surpassed this by the time you read this). It would simply not be a nuanced argument if free will encompasses being able to travel from point A to Z guaranteed. Thus, we will only consider free will as the guarantee of simple action-reaction pairs, which could lead to the accomplishment of broader goals.

## Conclusion

While the spaces vs. tabs debate might not have a one-size-fits-all answer, it underscores the importance of consistency, readability, and team collaboration in software development. Whether a team chooses spaces, tabs, or a hybrid approach, the key is to make a conscious choice that serves the project's needs and to adhere to it throughout the codebase. As with many aspects of coding, communication and agreement among team members are paramount to navigating this classic programming debate.
