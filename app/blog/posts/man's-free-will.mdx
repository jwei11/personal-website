summary: 'The struggle of man to achieve free will'

I must preface this by saying that I am no expert in this subject. I have merely come across this subject and done some surface-level Internet research. Reading the works of Plato, Hegel, Hobbes, and Daniel Dennett likely provides deeper analysis of the subject. I am here to simply provide my own perspective.

Let us first dive into what man's free will is.

## The Definition of Free Will

Just as any typical topic exploration begins, let us refer to the dictionary. Oxford Languages defines free will as "the power of acting without the constraint of necessity or fate; the ability to act at one's own discretion." So, free will is essentially being able to act without restraint. If I want to take a shower after a long day, I use, theoretically, my free will to take that shower. 

So, we see that, in its simplest form, it is wanting to do something, and being able to do it freely. Yet, we can expand the definition to a broader scale, where our desires may not be as linear. Say I have a goal of make a million dollars before I am twenty years old. Free will, theoretically, would allow me to produce and act in a series of ways to achieve such a goal, although whether I pursue the correct path is another question. Each action will produce an optimal result I desire, which will culminate in my bank account reaching seven figures before I turn twenty.

However, this poses another interesting question: if I do need to choose a correct sequence of events, and there are realities where I do not meet my goal, is it really free will? Would free will not be just be the ability to achieve whatever I desire? While this could, technically speaking, fall under the umbrella of free will, I feel that this is an idealistic version of free will. In this case, we would have the free will to become God, turn everyone into monkeys, or become the world's first trillionaire (or, perhaps, Elon Musk has already surpassed this by the time you read this). It would simply not be a nuanced argument if free will encompassed being able to travel from point A to Z guaranteed. Thus, we will only consider free will as the guarantee of simple action-reaction pairs, which could lead to the accomplishment of broader goals.

## Free Will as a Function of Our Anatomy 

Let us first consider the most basic aspect of free will: being able to move. If I want to move my arms such that I may fulfill my will of hugging my cat Artemis, my arms would comply and hug Artemis. Or, an even simpler motion: I want to move my foot to the right of where I am facing. Our physical body and will are so intertwined that there is little delay between our will's willing power and our body's movement. 

So, if we are able to move as we will, we must have *some* free will, do we not? Unfortunately, it is not that simple. Our biological realm consists of many functioning parts, each serving a different purpose. One could say that they each have a will of their own. The heart pumps blood such that our circulation remains steady. The white blood cells fight off pathogens. Because our human anatomy is so complex, there are often conflicts in "will." For example, our white blood cell may face a pathogen, which it is trying to exterminate. The pathogen's "will" is to multiply within the body. The two "wills" conflict, so in this case, at least one will not be able to fulfill its "will."

The overall body may face a similar situation. Taking the example of moving my foot to the right, if my body were paralyzed from the waist down, I would be unable to accomplish such a feat. If my will is to feel joy in every moment of life, a slight increase of testosterone during my hormonal growth stages may cause me to adopt an aggressive, angry mindset. Thus, anatomical factors may interfere with our will and prevent it from achieving its vision.  

## Free Will as a Function of Our Environment

- Talk about how our environment includes many different conflicting wills that prevent us from achieving our will freely

## Free Will as a Function of Our Psychology

To me, this is the most interesting aspect of free will. 

- Talk about Sigmund Freud's id, ego, and superego, as well as the IFS model by Richard Schwartz

## Conclusion

I believe that we each do have a restricted will. Its vision may be vast, yet due to a combination of anatomical, environmental, and psychological factors, the will can never fulfill its vision.
