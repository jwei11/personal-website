summary: 'The struggle of man to achieve free will'
---

I must preface this by saying that I am no expert in this subject. I have merely come across this subject and done some surface-level Internet research. Reading the works of Plato, Hegel, Hobbes, and Daniel Dennett likely provides deeper analysis of the subject. I am here to simply provide my own perspective.

Let us first dive into what man's free will is.

## The Definition of Free Will

Just as any typical topic exploration begins, let us refer to the dictionary. Oxford Languages defines free will as "the power of acting without the constraint of necessity or fate; the ability to act at one's own discretion." So, free will is essentially being able to act without restraint. If I want to take a shower after a long day, I use, theoretically, my free will to take that shower. 

So, we see that, in its simplest form, it is wanting to do something, and being able to do it freely. Yet, we can expand the definition to a broader scale, where our desires may not be as linear. Say I have a goal of make a million dollars before I am twenty years old. Free will, theoretically, would allow me to produce and act in a series of ways to achieve such a goal, although whether I pursue the correct path is another question. Each action will produce an optimal result I desire, which will culminate in my bank account reaching seven figures before I turn twenty.

However, this poses another interesting question: if I do need to choose a correct sequence of events, and there are realities where I do not meet my goal, is it really free will? Would free will not be just be the ability to achieve whatever I desire? While this could, technically speaking, fall under the umbrella of free will, I feel that this is an idealistic version of free will. In this case, we would have the free will to become God, turn everyone into monkeys, or become the world's first trillionaire (or, perhaps, Elon Musk has already surpassed this by the time you read this). It would simply not be a nuanced argument if free will encompassed being able to travel from point A to Z guaranteed. Thus, we will only consider free will as the guarantee of simple action-reaction pairs, which could lead to the accomplishment of broader goals.

## Free Will as a Function of Our Anatomy 

Let us first consider the most basic aspect of free will: being able to move. If I want to move my arms such that I may fulfill my will of hugging my cat Artemis, my arms would comply and hug Artemis. Or, an even simpler motion: I want to move my foot to the right of where I am facing. Our physical body and will are so intertwined that there is little delay between our will's willing power and our body's movement. 

So, if we are able to move as we will, we must have *some* free will, do we not? Unfortunately, it is not that simple. Our biological realm consists of many functioning parts, each serving a different purpose. One could say that they each have a will of their own. The heart pumps blood such that our circulation remains steady. The white blood cells fight off pathogens. Because our human anatomy is so complex, there are often conflicts in "will." For example, our white blood cell may face a pathogen, which it is trying to exterminate. The pathogen's "will" is to multiply within the body. The two "wills" conflict, so in this case, at least one will not be able to fulfill its "will."

The overall body may face a similar situation. Taking the example of moving my foot to the right, if my body were paralyzed from the waist down, I would be unable to accomplish such a feat. If my will is to feel joy in every moment of life, a slight increase of testosterone during my hormonal growth stages may cause me to adopt an aggressive, angry mindset. Thus, anatomical factors may interfere with our will and prevent it from achieving its vision.  

## Free Will as a Function of Our Environment

Let us now take a look at another realm of free will: our environment. This is perhaps the easiest to disprove. Let's examine an example. Say you want to watch a Warriors basketball game live without paying for a ticket. First, you may not even be able to leave your home without being stopped. If you live with strict parents, or a partner, they may stop you from even beginning such a task. They do not want you to commit a crime, and waste time and money (from transportation fees) in doing so. One could say they have the will to help you make the right decision. Say you do get past them (in which you overcome their will to stop you), or they are not there to stop you. You will still need to get past the security guards that check your tickets. They have a will to stop anyone without a ticket from entering the stadium. Either you accomplish your will and sneak past them, or they accomplish their will and you do not enter the stadium.

From this example, we see that our world contains many different wills. In fact, we, technically, can extend the possession of wills to animals and objects as well. Animals have a will to obtain food for themselves and their family, as well as protect and reproduce. If you met a wild black bear in the forest and want to get around it, for example, it may attack you if it perceives you as a threat. Objects, animate or inanimate, have a will to act according to the laws of physics. If you want to lift a 50kg weight, it will be a difficult task, or even impossible depending on your strength. Wills tend to conflict in our everyday lives. Thus, it is impossible for us to have a free will in our everyday environment.

## Free Will as a Function of Our Psychology

To me, this is the most interesting aspect of free will. We will begin by examining psychological theories that, although not scientifically based, provide a unique insight to our brain's function. Sigmund Freud, an Austrian neurologist who lived in the late 1800s and early 1900s, examined our psychology from the perspective of "psychoanalysis." Within this perspective, he theorized that each person had an "id," "ego," and "superego" that influence how we think and act. Our "id" is the instinct-driven part of our mind that seeks instant gratification. It is willing to bypass our morals for instant pleasure (think intrusive thoughts, crimes). Our superego, on the other hand, is our desire to conform to society's norms and our personal morals. The ego seeks to mediate between the two psychological forces by finding a middle ground. Similar theories, like the Internal Family Systems Model proposed by Richard Schwartz, propose similar ideas of having conflicting psychological forces within. 

If our psychology itself contains many different conflicting wills, and we only have one body to carry out an ultimate will, it is clear that free will cannot exist. One psychological force will need to compromise with another psychological force. While these theories have no concrete scientific basis, I think we all have experiences where we are conflicted in what to do. One side of us feels a certain way, and another feels a different, conflicting way.

## Conclusion

I believe that we each do have a restricted will. Its vision may be vast, yet due to a combination of anatomical, environmental, and psychological factors, the will can never fulfill its vision.
